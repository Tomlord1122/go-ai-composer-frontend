This style guide primarily uses subtle grayscale colors and Inter/serif fonts.

Color Summary
• Background: #EDEDED (light gray)
• Text:
▫ Primary: gray-700, gray-800, gray-900
▫ Secondary: gray-500, gray-600
• Borders/Dividers: gray-300, gray-400; lists use divide-gray-100
• Cards/Surfaces: white background, gray borders, subtle shadows
• Accent Colors (for actions/states only):
▫ Primary actions: bg-blue-600 (darker on hover)
▫ Success/confirmation: bg-green-600
▫ Danger: bg-red-600/700
▫ Progress bars: gray gradient (from-gray-300 to-gray-400)

Font Style Summary
• Base UI: Inter (sans-serif), readable font sizes
• Titles/Long-form: font-serif (serif), used for section titles and long-form content
• Long-form content: must use Tailwind’s prose classes (prose-sm, elevated to sm:prose-base or sm:prose-lg as needed)

Additional Notes
• Titles and long-form content use serif fonts, with font size adjusted as needed.
• Interactive elements (such as buttons and links) default to sans-serif fonts, and only use blue/green/red when semantically required.
• The overall design is grayscale-first; color is reserved for actions or state indication, maintaining a calm and readable interface.
