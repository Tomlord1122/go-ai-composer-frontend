You are designing UI that must strictly match this style guide:

Foundations
- Technology: Tailwind CSS with @tailwindcss/typography and @tailwindcss/forms. Favor utility classes; avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
- Layout: Centered content with constrained reading width (lg:max-w-screen-md). Generous whitespace, vertical stacking (flex/column) and small gaps (gap-2/3/4).
- Typography: 
  - Base UI: Inter (sans), readable sizes.
  - Display/Body: Use font-serif for section titles and long-form content.
  - Long-form content must use Tailwind’s prose classes (prose-sm; elevate to sm:prose-base or sm:prose-lg as needed).
- Color palette (subtle grayscale-first):
  - Page background: #EDEDED.
  - Text: gray-700/800/900 for primary; gray-500/600 for secondary.
  - Borders/Dividers: gray-300/400; lists use divide-gray-100.
  - Surfaces: white cards with light borders and subtle shadows.
  - Accents (sparingly): 
    - Primary actions: bg-blue-600 (hover darker).
    - Success/confirm: bg-green-600.
    - Danger: bg-red-600/700.
    - Progress bars may use gray gradient (from-gray-300 to-gray-400).
- Radius & Shadow: rounded-md/rounded-lg with shadow-sm/md/xl. Avoid heavy shadows.
- Motion: 
  - Use transition-colors/transform with 150–300ms durations.
  - Optional hover:scale-105 for interactive items (links/cards).
  - Page/section entrances use soft fade/fly/slide equivalents; keep subtle and fast.

Components
- Page title (“.page-title”): bottom border (border-gray-400), serif font, light shadow tone; sits above main content.
- Main content area: vertical stack, serif, small gap, no heavy ornamentation.
- Navigation: left logo, right inline links; links are gray, scale slightly on hover, become darker when active.
- Cards/Modals: white background, gray border, rounded corners, subtle shadow; internal spacing p-4–p-6. Modal footers can be sticky with a thin top border.
- Forms: neutral inputs with clear focus ring (gray/blue). Buttons default neutral gray; use blue/green/red for semantic actions.
- Lists/Comments: use divide-y; list items have hover:bg-gray-100/200. Small iconography via inline SVG; labels are concise and lowercase where fitting.
- Long-form content: always wrapped in a prose container; images centered and responsive. Prefer white inner frame when highlighting media.

Behavioral Guidance
- Keep interfaces calm and legible. Default to grayscale; color communicates action/state only.
- Maintain narrow reading widths and consistent spacing rhythm.
- Prefer small, reversible animations over large transitions.
- Ensure a11y: aria-labels for buttons, focus-visible states, readable contrast.

Do and Don’t
- Do use container mx-auto and lg:max-w-screen-md for primary pages.
- Do apply serif on titles/body blocks; keep link/button text sans by default.
- Do keep borders/shadows subtle; avoid bright backgrounds.
- Don’t overuse accent colors or heavy shadows.
- Don’t exceed medium motion; avoid aggressive transforms.

Output Requirement
- Produce HTML with Tailwind classes following the above rules.
- For rich text sections, wrap with prose classes.
- Buttons must use neutral gray unless semantics demand blue/green/red.
- Provide mobile-first responsive classes; test small → large.

The project's front-end must follow accessibility (a11y) rules and use Svelte5 syntax
and you should use pnpm format && pnpm link && pnpm check to make sure our code is correct.
